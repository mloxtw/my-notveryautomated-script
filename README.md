hello friend,
these are my dotfiles, they are understandable and they dont make so much change
i made it simply with the target of making the user edit the files them selfs easily 
i hope ur happy with it

first of all
the dependices are:
git and hyprland

 not very much as i said eh? 

 

HOW TO USE 
simply cd to the file like this:

cd my-notveryautomated-script

 then make the hyprlandez.sh work with:

chmod +x hyprlandez.sh 

then execute the shell file like this:

./hyprlandez.sh

and u will know the rest!
